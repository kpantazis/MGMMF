We consider the problem of detecting a noisy induced multiplex template networkin a larger multiplex background network.  Our approach, which extends the monoplex framework to the multiplex setting, leverages a multiplex analogue of the classical graphmatching  problem  to  use  the  template  as  a  matched  filter  for  efficiently  searchingthe background for candidate template matches.  The effectiveness of our approach isdemonstrated both theoretically and empirically, with particular attention paid to thepotential benefits of considering multiple channels.
